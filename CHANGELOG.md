## 1.4.1

* Enhanced sensitive data encryption with improved patterns for Authorization Bearer/Basic and token/API key variants, including case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant, quote-excluding regex with query string & delimiters
* Fixed encryption overlap merging to union adjacent/overlapping matches, preventing plaintext leaks

* Added tests for batch size changes, singleton reset, and concurrent operations
* Increased test coverage and improved test clarity

## 1.4.0

* Added `EncryptedIsolateFileLogHandler` for encrypting sensitive data in log messages (passwords, tokens, emails, phone numbers).
* Added `SensitiveDataEncryptor` interface with `AesGcmSensitiveDataEncryptor` implementation using AES-GCM encryption.
* Added `SensitiveDataMatcher` interface with `RegexSensitiveDataMatcher` for customizable sensitive data detection patterns.
* Added configurable encryption failure handlers: `PlaintextFallbackHandler`, `MarkerFallbackHandler`, `RedactFallbackHandler`.
* Added browser-based decryption tool at `scripts/aes-gcm/decrypt.html` for QA/support staff.
* Added security warnings in documentation about error objects not being encrypted.
* Improved `BDLogger` destroy flow with `_isDestroying` flag to prevent log dropping during shutdown.
* Improved log processing race condition handling.

## 1.3.3

* Fixed race condition in `clean()` method where concurrent calls could cause callers to wait forever.
* Fixed `LateInitializationError` when log records arrive before worker initialization.
* Fixed ReceivePort resource leaks in both main and worker isolates.
* Fixed redundant `ErrorController` double-close in `destroy()`.
* Fixed `BDLogRecord` assertion for `isFatal` flag to properly require an error.
* Added `maxFilesCount > 0` validation to prevent immediate log file deletion.
* Improved `DateFormat` performance by caching instance as static final.
* Improved `BDLogRecord.hashCode` using `Object.hash()` for fewer collisions.
* Added `const` constructor to `BDLogError` for performance.
* Fixed log record ordering by awaiting `handleRecord` in worker.
* Added comprehensive regression tests for all fixes.

* Refactored handlePortMessage into focused methods following Single Responsibility Principle.

## 1.3.1
